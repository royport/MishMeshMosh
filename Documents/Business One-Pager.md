### MishMeshMosh

**A demand-first platform that turns shared needs into supplier-ready contract packets.**

### The problem

Shared needs exist everywhere — but there is no infrastructure for initiators.

People can gather interest around a product or service, yet lack a trusted way to define terms, aggregate commitment, and present suppliers with something real — without risk, upfront payments, or legal complexity.

Because of this, demand stays fragmented, leverage disappears, and most initiatives die before they ever become executable.

### The insight

**MishMeshMosh makes NEED the catalyst, not a reaction to supply**
Here, **anyone — especially end users — can raise a real need first**, validate it with others, and then route that demand to suppliers under **clear, pre-defined terms** — using deeds.

This lets people **experience what entrepreneurs do** — defining demand, setting terms, and triggering supply — **without taking heavy upfront risk**.

### How it works (Need → Seed → Feed → Reed) - with Deed in every step

1. **Need Campaign:** Initiator publishes a Kickstarter-like campaign describing goods/services and target thresholds.
    
2. **Need Deed:** Backers join by digitally signing a **non-binding, transferable** deed with itemized rows (variants, qty, constraints).
    
3. **Seed:** When thresholds are met, the need becomes a validated **Seed**.
    
4. **Feed Campaign:** Suppliers are invited to fulfill the aggregated demand.
    
5. **Feed Deed:** Supplier signs an agreement to supply the total qty/value under stated terms.
    
6. **Reed Deed:** Platform assigns the batch of Need Deeds to the supplier and defines **WEED** commissions (initiator + platform).
    
7. Supplier fulfills and collects payments per the agreed rails (outside the platform).
    

### Why it wins

- **Demand originates anywhere**: end users, groups, resellers, even manufacturers.
    
- **Trust through documents**: deeds create enforceable clarity without payment custody.
    
- **Supplier-ready aggregation**: suppliers see totals, not chaos.
    
- **Private group campaigns**:  communities can coordinate purchases without forming a company, while suppliers can offer better pricing privately without undermining the public perceived value of their goods or services.
    
- **Scales across goods + services**: from bulk items to service bundles.
    

### Business model (WEED)

A commission/fee defined in the Reed Deed:

- Platform WEED (marketplace fee)
    
- Initiator WEED (reward for organizing/initiating the validated need)
    

### Target users

- Organized communities with recurring needs (parents groups, veterans, neighborhoods)
    
- SMBs pooling procurement (restaurants, small contractors)
    
- Niche enthusiasts (hobby gear, parts, special imports)
    
- Services with standardized deliverables (installations, training, consulting bundles)
    
- Bulk buyers that would like to sell the items before buying the items.
