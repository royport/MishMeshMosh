### **Key UX principles**

- Deeds are **first-class UX objects**  
    Always visible, reviewable, versioned, and downloadable.
    
- Dashboards show **obligations, not buttons**  
    “What am I bound to?” comes before “What can I do?”
    
- Need and Feed are **separate UX worlds**  
    Linked only through Seed and Assignment (Reed).
